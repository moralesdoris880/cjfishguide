# C.J.'s Fishing Guide
Fishing Guide made for Animal Crossing New Horizon players using the ACNH API, HTML5, CSS5, and JS.

##About the Project 

This project was inspired by my love for fishing and video games. I wanted to be able to make a website that allows anyone from any skill-level playing Animal Crossing New Horizons to learn how to fish or use the fish guide to catch specific fish depending on the players location and time. The fish guide was specifically based on the character C.J who hosts fish tournaments and sells fish within the game. I originally intended to make a fish guide for New York but since I was unable to decide which API to use I just combined two ideas into one.
